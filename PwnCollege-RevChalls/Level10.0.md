# Level 10.0

## Challenge Objectives

Reverse engineer this challenge to find the correct license key, but your input will be modified somehow before being compared to the correct key. This challenge allows you to patch 1 byte in the binary.

## Approach

Pretty much the same approach as the previous two levels.
