First, I created a new file called "delete_me" using the **"touch"** command.

**Command**-  touch delete_me

Then I used the **"rm"** command to delete this file.

**Command**-  rm delete_me

Then I ran the "/challenge/check"  command to verify that the file was deleted.

**Command** -  /challenge/check

This executed perfectly and I got the flag.
