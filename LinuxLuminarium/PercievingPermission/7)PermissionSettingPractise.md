# Permission Setting Practise

## Basic Understanding

`chmod` can also simply set permissions. This is done by using `=`.

Examples -

- **u=rw** sets read and write permissions for the user, and wipes the execute permission.
- **o=x** sets only executable permissions for the world, wiping read and write.
- **a=rwx** sets read, write, and executable permissions for the user, group, and others.

## Challenge Goals

In this challenge also we need to change permissions 8 times so I have attached the screenshot of each round below.
