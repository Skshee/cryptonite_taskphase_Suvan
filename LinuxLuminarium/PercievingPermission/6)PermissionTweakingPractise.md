# Permission Tweaking Practise

## Challenge Objectives

The objective of this challenge is to practise  permission tweaking in Linux and making the user more efficient in using permissions effectively.

## Challenge goals

This challenge will ask you to change the permissions of the `/challenge/pwn`.  If we get the permissions right eight times in a row, the challenge will let you `chmod /flag` to make it readable for yourself.

Okay so this was a very lenghty challenge so I'll just paste the screenshots as they are pretty self explanatory.
