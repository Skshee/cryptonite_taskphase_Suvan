`Command Substitution` - When we store the output of some command to a variable.

## Challenge Objectives

The objective of this challenge is to teach the user `Command Substitution`  and how to store the output of a command to a variable.

## Challenge Goals

In this challenge, we must read the output of the `/challenge/run` command directly into a variable called `PWN`, and it will contain the flag.
