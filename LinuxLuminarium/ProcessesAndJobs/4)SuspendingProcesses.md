`Ctrl-Z` - Used to suspend processes to the background

## Challenge Objectives

The objective of this challenge is to teach the user how to suspend a running process to the background in the Linux CLI.

## Challenge Goals

This level's run wants to see another copy of itself running and using the same terminal.

I ran the `/challenge/run` program first and then used  `Ctrl-Z` to suspend it. Then I ran the `/challenge/run` program again and since  the first one was suspended, it ran in the background. Now I have two copies of the /challenge/run programs.

From this, I obtained the flag.
