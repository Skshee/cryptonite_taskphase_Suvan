# Introduction to Commands

The Hello Hackers Module is a series designed to introduce one to the world of Linux and the command line interface.

## Basic Terminologies

**Secure Shell(ssh)** - A network protocol that allows us to connect to a host computer from a remote network through a secure encrypted medium.

**$ - Command Prompt** - It is the shellâ€™s way of indicating that the shell is ready to accept the next command

## Challenge Goal 

The goal of this level is to invoke a command and obtain a flag after entering the right command.

After I start the challenge on my browser's Linux Luminarium,I used **ssh -i ./key hacker@dojo.pwn.college** to connect to the server where I'll be solving the challenge from my local computer network.

As you can see once we have logged in, my username i.e suvan has changed to hacker and my hostname i.e Suvan has changed to hello-intro-to-commands.

The command that I need to enter here to obtain the flag is hello.

**Command** - hello

After entering this command, I successfully obtained the flag.

## Flag

**pwn.college{4x8mI8ENOTBDP6vNMNmIi859lGE.ddjNyUDLzITO0czW}**
